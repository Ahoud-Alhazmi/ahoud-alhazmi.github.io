I am a dedicated contributor to the academic community, serving as a peer reviewer for prestigious, high- impact journals and as a program committee member for leading international conferences. My editorial work includes evaluating submissions for top-tier Q1 journals such as IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (IF: 14.3), IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (IF: 8.0), and IEEE Transactions on Service Computing (IF: 5.8). I have also been an active member of the Technical Program Committee for the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) from 2023-2025 and have served on the program committees for numerous other flagship events, including the International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing (ICSOC), IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS), and the Australian Conference on Information Systems (ACIS).
